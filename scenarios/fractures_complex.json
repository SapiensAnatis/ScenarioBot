They are complaining that one of the players kicked them. The other players are all stood around doing very little, and as it's a practice there are no first aiders around, though there is a first aid kit. You observe sharp, intense, throbbing of mid lower leg/tib fib. Their lower leg is quite bruised and swollen, with visible imprint of stud marks. There is a small wound on one of the stud imprints, which is slightly bleeding, but is able to be controlled by plaster and gentle pressure. The wound site is quite dirty/muddy. The leg does not look visibly deformed. Patient is sat up on arrival.",
